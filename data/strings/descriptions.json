The Champion is a solid and capable contender, able to face capital ships on the battle-line.\\n\\nA relatively recent design, the Champion is a product of the historically recent \"Cruiser School\" naval revolution that never saw active service in the pre-collapse Domain Armada. Although prototypes were constructed and forge-ready specifications distributed to several battlegroups, the Champion was never cleared for active deployment due to an ongoing lawsuit between Altair Exotech and Orion Shipyards. Each megacorp accused the other of industrial espionage and innappropriately influencing the Armada officers overseeing the procurement process. The truth was more complex, inflaming longstanding rivalries in the officer corps as the investigatory committee called witness after witness. The Collapse prevented any sort of conclusive ruling from reaching the Persean Sector however, and now the entire matter is considered irrelevant. With the discovery of Champion plans on a Domain armaments courier, the warship was quickly put into service by the fleet of the Persean League, among others.",
